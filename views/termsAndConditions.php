        <h2>3. Orders and Sales Conditions</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Personalized (Laser Engraving) Products</h3>
        <p>
            Due to the **personalized nature** of our engraving products, the following conditions apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design Confirmation:</strong> Once the final design is approved by the customer, no cancellations or modifications are allowed.</li>
            <li><strong>Illegal/Offensive Content:</strong> We reserve the right to refuse any engraving request that we deem unlawful, obscene, defamatory, or that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
            <li><strong>Returns:</strong> Personalized products are **not eligible for return or refund**, unless the error is ours (e.g., a mistake in the engraving or a manufacturing defect).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2. Pricing and Payment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All prices are subject to change without notice. Payment must be made in full before the engraving process or shipping begins.
            <li>Most of our products are custom-made, so pricing and timelines may vary depending on the design, material, and complexity.
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3. Custom Products</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Since most of our items are personalized, we cannot accept returns once production has started or the product has been delivered, unless there is an error on our part (e.g., wrong engraving, defective product).
            </li>
            <li>
                We always provide a proof or mockup before production, so customers can review and approve their design.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>3.4. Cancellations</h3>
        <p>
            Orders can be cancelled within 24 hours of placement without penalty. After that, cancellation may not be possible if production has begun.
        </p>
        <h3>3.5. Refunds / Exchanges</h3>
        <p>
            If a mistake is made on our side, we will gladly replace the item or offer a refund. We want customers to feel confident and satisfied with their order.
            <li><strong>Standard / Non-Custom Products:</strong> These may be eligible for returns within 7 days if unused and in original condition.</li>
        </p>
        <h3>3.6. Events</h3>
        <p>
            We recommend contacting us in advance for weddings, corporate events, or large orders, so we can ensure enough production time.
